# Snort IDS Setup and Rule Configuration

## Objective
The Snort IDS setup aimed to configure an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) on an Ubuntu server to monitor network traffic for suspicious activity. By creating and fine-tuning Snort rules, the project enhanced the ability to detect and respond to various types of attacks. The network was also tested using Kali Linux with Legion to simulate real-world penetration testing scenarios and validate the IDS configuration.

### Skills Learned
- Practical experience in setting up and configuring Snort IDS on Ubuntu.
- Understanding of network traffic analysis and detection of malicious patterns.
- Experience with creating custom Snort rules for attack detection.
- Hands-on experience with penetration testing using Kali Linux and Legion.
- Enhanced ability to tune and optimize IDS rules for better detection accuracy.
- Understanding of network security monitoring and incident response.

### Tools Used
- **Snort** for network intrusion detection and prevention.
- **Ubuntu** for Snort installation and configuration.
- **Kali Linux** and **Legion** for penetration testing and attack simulation.
- **Wireshark** for packet analysis and verification of attacks.
- **Snort Rules** for detecting specific attack patterns and signatures.
